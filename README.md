# Mixed-MNIST_digits-CNN
Mixed mnist data preparing training data and used convolutional neural network. 

I divided that mixed mnist progam to following theree section:
1.	Input test data which is given by professor. And I did a little bit analyzing and visualized. 
2.	Prepared training dataset by myself. I made mixed training mnist dataset using individual images which are given last assignment.   
3.	Building convolutional neural network for mixed mnist. 

Notice: I used testing set matlab data. For training data, I prepared by myself using MNIST .png images.
